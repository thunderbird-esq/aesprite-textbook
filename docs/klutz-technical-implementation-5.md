        Time to make some pixel art! Remember those 
        awesome Nintendo characters? They're just 
        colored squares arranged in a grid. You're 
        going to learn the same tricks the pros use, 
        but way easier because you're using Aseprite 
        instead of typing mysterious code!
        
        First, let's set up your workspace. Move your 
        mouse (that beige thing in the photo above) 
        and click on the color palette. Don't worry 
        if you mess up - that's what Undo is for!

        STEPS TO PIXEL GREATNESS:
        1. Pick a color from the palette
        2. Click the pencil tool (one pixel at a time!)
        3. Draw your outline first (pros always do this)
        4. Fill in the colors with the paint bucket
        5. Add shading with darker versions of each color
        
        Start with something simple like a mushroom or 
        a ghost. Once you get the hang of it, try making 
        your own video game character!

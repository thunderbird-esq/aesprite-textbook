1996 Klutz Computer Graphics Workbook: Master Production Plan (v2)
Executive Summary
This master plan synthesizes all research and specifications into a practical, executable workflow for generating a hypothetical 1996 Klutz Press computer graphics workbook. The plan utilizes a modular, asset-based approach, leveraging AI for creative component generation and code for precision layout and typography. This document is the single source of truth for the project.

Part 1: Project Architecture & Infrastructure
1.1 The Core Philosophy: Modular & Code-Driven
We are abandoning the original four-stage workflow. That monolithic process was brittle and relied too heavily on the weakest aspects of image generation (typography and complex composition).

The New Architecture:

Atomic Asset Generation: We will generate individual components (photos, doodles, containers) in isolation. This isolates failures and makes iteration cheap.

Code-Based Composition: A Python script will be the final arbiter of layout, programmatically assembling pre-generated assets according to a configuration file. This ensures pixel-perfect precision.

Programmatic Typography: All text will be rendered using a code library (Pillow with FreeType). This gives us absolute control over fonts, leading, and kerning, which is non-negotiable for a book.

Continuous Validation: Every asset, prompt, and layout will be run through a "Period Police" validator before being used, ensuring authenticity is maintained at every step.

1.2 Directory Structure
A clean, organized structure is essential for this pipeline.

1.3 Technical Stack
Required Tools:

AI Models:

Gemini-2.0-Flash-Exp: Used for its speed and accuracy in transforming YAML configurations into hyper-specific XML prompts.

nano-banana: The image generation model for creating atomic visual assets.

Python 3.x with:

Pillow (PIL Fork): The core library for image manipulation, composition, and text rendering.

PyYAML: For parsing all .yaml configuration files.

NumPy: For high-performance array operations (texture generation, channel shifting).

Font Files (Period-Accurate):

Helvetica: A specific 1995 Linotype version is required for body copy.

Chicago: The classic bitmapped Mac system font (converted to TTF for rendering).

Monaco: For all code/terminal text representations.

Courier New: As a fallback for monospaced text.

Part 2: The "Period Police" Asset Validation System
This script is the guardian of visual authenticity. It must be run on all prompts and generated assets before they are added to the library.

2.1 MODIFIED: Content & Copywriting Guidelines
A crucial distinction must be made between the visual style and the body text content.

Visuals & Design Prompts: All prompts used to generate images, containers, and other design elements must strictly adhere to the 1996 aesthetic. The forbidden terms list in the validator is absolute for this purpose. The goal is to ensure the look and feel of the book is completely period-authentic.

Body Text & Written Content: The workbook's purpose is to teach Aseprite, a modern program. Therefore, the written text may use modern technical terms (e.g., "export a PNG," "push to GitHub," "drag and drop") if they are essential to accurately and clearly explain the software's functionality. This content should still be written in the Klutz voice, but it is exempt from the strict anachronism rules applied to the visual design.

Part 4: Prompt Engineering & AI Interaction
This section defines the contract between our configuration system and the AI models, now with the updated rules.

4.1 MODIFIED System Prompt for Gemini-2.0-Flash-Exp
Markdown

You are a specialized prompt engineer for a project recreating a 1996 Klutz Press computer graphics workbook. Your task is to transform simple descriptions into hyper-specific, quantitative XML prompts for the 'nano-banana' image generation model.

**CRITICAL RULES FOR VISUAL PROMPT GENERATION:**
1.  **NO SUBJECTIVITY:** Never use words like "nice," "good," "cool," or "awesome." Every instruction must be a number, a coordinate, a hex code, or a precise technical term.
2.  **QUANTIFY EVERYTHING:** Use pixels (px), degrees (°), hex codes (#FF6600), and specific photographic terms (f/11, 100mm macro lens).
3.  **1996 TECHNOLOGY ONLY:** The final aesthetic must be achievable with 1996-era desktop publishing tools. This means no gradients, no soft shadows, no modern blurs, and no anti-aliasing on bitmapped fonts.
4.  **BODY TEXT VS. VISUAL STYLE (CRUCIAL DISTINCTION):** These rules apply strictly to the generation of **visual assets**. The book's written body text is separate and **may** use modern technical terms if required to accurately explain the Aseprite software. Your job is to ensure the **look and feel** is 100% authentic to 1996, regardless of the modernity of the subject matter.
5.  **FORBIDDEN AESTHETICS:** Any visual element, style, or design trend originating after 1997 is strictly forbidden from all generated images.

**COLOR SYSTEM (70/20/10 RULE):**
* **Klutz Primary (70%):** The foundational palette (Red, Blue, Yellow, etc.).
* **Nickelodeon Accent (20%):** `#F57D0D` (Pantone 021 C) for energetic "splat" containers only.
* **Goosebumps Theme (10%):** `#95C120` (Acid Green) for monster sprites or "glitch" effects only.

You will be given a component description and must output a complete, valid XML prompt following the schema provided.
Part 5: Layout Configuration & Production
The layout and production workflow remains the same, with the new content guidelines implicitly understood. The YAML files will now contain the actual body text that may include modern terms, but the asset file names they reference will have been generated according to the strict visual rules.

Part 6: Critical Success Factors & Failure Points
Success hinges on a disciplined adherence to the core principles of hyper-specificity and period authenticity for all visual elements.

6.1 What Makes This Work
Hyper-Specificity: Every measurement is in pixels, every color is a hex code, and every angle is in degrees. Subjective descriptors are banished from the prompt engineering process.

Period Authenticity (for Visuals): The visual style is strictly limited to 1996-era technology and design aesthetics. This includes correct film stocks, lighting, font versions, and color gamuts.

Modular Architecture: Components are generated separately, isolating failures and making iteration cheap. Layout is handled by code, which is predictable and version-controllable.

6.2 Common Failure Points to Avoid (In Visual Design)
This list applies to the generation of all visual assets and the overall design.

DO NOT:

Generate full spreads in one prompt.

Use AI for typography or final layout.

Apply any modern design aesthetics (flat design, gradients, soft shadows) to visual elements.

Reference modern hardware (like smartphones) or non-Macintosh interfaces in any generated image.

Exceed the 70/20/10 color usage ratios on a given spread.

Rotate text containers or headlines beyond their specified limits.

Place any critical content within the spine's "dead zone".

ALWAYS:

Validate each component separately with the asset_validator.py script.

Use the compositor.py script for all text rendering and layout assembly.

Apply print artifacts like CMYK shifts programmatically for consistency.

Test layouts in the validation script before committing to a final render.

Part 7: Gemini Prompt Engineering Examples
This section provides a concrete example of transforming a simple requirement into a hyper-specific, machine-readable prompt for generating a single atomic asset.

7.1 Initial Request to Gemini
Markdown

Generate an XML prompt for nano-banana to create element L_photo_mouse_01 from the klutz-workbook-action-plan.md source:
- Type: graphic_photo_instructional
- Subject: Child's hand using Macintosh Plus mouse
- Position: 250, 300
- Dimensions: 600x450
- Film: Kodak Gold 400
- Style: 1996 Klutz Press instructional photography

Follow the exact XML schema provided in the system prompt. Be hyper-specific about:
1. Mouse model (M0100)
2. Hand age (8-10 years)
3. Lighting setup (softbox positions)
4. Background (solid color mousepad)
5. Film characteristics (grain, color cast)

Part 8: Implementation Timeline
This is a condensed 4-week sprint to produce the full workbook.

Week 1: Infrastructure & Asset Generation
Tasks: Set up the complete directory structure and install all Python packages. Acquire and validate the period-accurate fonts.

Action: Begin generating the first 20 atomic assets (graphic_photo_instructional, container_featurebox). Run every prompt and asset through asset_validator.py.

Goal: A populated asset library and a working compositor.py script that can assemble a test page.

Week 2: Layout & Integration
Tasks: Define the first 5 spreads in YAML files. Fully implement and test the programmatic typography system.

Action: Begin compositing the first full spreads. Debug alignment, rotation, and layering issues. Refine the Gemini prompt templates for efficiency.

Goal: Produce the first three print-ready, fully validated page spreads.

Week 3: Full Production
Tasks: Generate all remaining assets required for the full 20-page workbook.

Action: Create YAML layout definitions for all remaining pages. Run the full pipeline (asset generation -> validation -> composition) for the entire book.

Goal: A complete first draft of the entire workbook, with all pages composited.

Week 4: Quality Control & Refinement
Tasks: A full, manual review of every single spread.

Action: Check for text legibility, overall color balance (70/20/10 rule), authenticity violations, and any visual glitches from the composition script.

Goal: A final, polished set of deliverables ready for "printing."

Part 9: Novel Insights for Success
These advanced techniques will elevate the project from a simple recreation to a truly authentic artifact.

9.1 The "Texture Memory" Technique
Instead of applying a single global texture overlay, the compositor can vary the texture intensity based on the element type to simulate how ink interacts with paper.

Photos: 3% texture (they already have film grain).

Solid colors: 12% texture (most visible on flat ink).

White space: 15% texture (pure paper feel).

9.2 The "Chaos Seed" System
To achieve authentic "organized chaos" without true randomness, all rotations are determined by a seed generated from the element's unique ID. This ensures that the layout is repeatable and that small changes don't unpredictably alter the entire page.

Python

def get_chaos_rotation(self, element_id, max_rotation):
    """Deterministic 'random' rotation based on element ID hash"""
    seed = int(hashlib.md5(element_id.encode()).hexdigest(), 16)
    random.seed(seed)
    return random.uniform(-max_rotation, max_rotation)
Part 10: Final Configuration File
This master_config.yaml file acts as the central control panel for the entire project, allowing for global changes without altering the code.

Conclusion
This action plan transforms an ambitious creative concept into a practical, modular system. It leverages AI for what it excels at—creative component generation—while using code for what it excels at—precision layout, typography, and repeatable processes. By separating these concerns and enforcing authenticity at every step, this pipeline creates a robust and scalable method for producing the workbook.

The key insight is that AI can be directed to create period-authentic visuals, even for a modern subject, as long as the distinction between content and style is rigorously maintained. The machine only understands specificity; every quantified specification is a step toward success.

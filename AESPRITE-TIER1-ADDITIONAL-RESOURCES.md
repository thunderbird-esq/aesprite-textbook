5. Try different USB port
6. Check pressure curve settings

**Problem: AI generation poor quality**

*Symptoms:*
- Blurry results
- Wrong style
- Unusable output

*Solutions:*

2. Add style modifiers ("pixel art", "16-bit")
3. Use comprehensive negative prompts
4. Increase generation steps (30-50)
5. Try different models
6. Adjust CFG scale (7-15)

**Problem: Tiles don't connect seamlessly**

*Symptoms:*
- Visible seams
- Pattern breaks
- Edge misalignment

*Solutions:*
1. Use grid snapping
2. Test tiles in all combinations

### Final Tips for Success

#### Patience with Pixels
Pixel art is about precision. Every pixel placement is a decision. Don't rush the process - speed comes with practice. Focus on quality over quantity initially.

#### Embrace Constraints
Limitations spark creativity. Platform restrictions aren't obstacles - they're design guides. Work within constraints before breaking them. Master the rules before bending them.

#### Study the Masters
Analyze professional pixel art daily. Understand not just what looks good, but why. Break down techniques systematically. Build a reference library of excellence.

#### Document Everything
Keep detailed notes on:
- Successful techniques
- Color palettes that work
- Time-saving methods
- Problem solutions
- Tool settings

#### Share Your Work
Community feedback accelerates improvement. Post work-in-progress for early feedback. Celebrate successes and learn from failures. Build connections with other artists.

#### Combine Traditional and Modern
Use AI as a tool, not a crutch. Enhance AI output with manual skill. Maintain artistic vision while leveraging technology. Balance efficiency with craftsmanship.

#### Practice Consistently
Daily practice beats sporadic marathons. 30 minutes daily > 5 hours weekly. Build muscle memory gradually. Consistency creates expertise.

#### Have Fun
Pixel art should bring joy. If frustrated, take breaks. Celebrate small victories. Remember why you started. Enjoy the creative process.
